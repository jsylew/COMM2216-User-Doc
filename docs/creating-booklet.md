# Creating a Print-Ready Booklet

In this section, you will be able to create and export a Print-Ready booklet using Adobe InDesign.

1. Open the InDesign Application and click <b>Create New</b> on the left to create a new document.

2. Set your document size.
  <b>Note:</b> Letter size is the most commonly used aper size in North America.  These instructions will continue with letter size, but you may choose whichever size suits your project.
  
3. Select <b>Print</b> from the top menu so that the booklet is optimized for printing.

4. Fill in your <b>Project Details</b> in the form on the right side:
* Type in the name of your project.
* Check that width and height are set to match the document size selected in <b>Step 2</b>.
* Set units to Inches.
* Select orientation. (these instructions will use portrait)
* Check the <b>Facing Pages</b> box.
* Select the number of pages needed for your booklet.
> <b>Note:</b> The number of pages for printing a booklet must be a multiple of 4. (4, 8, 12, etc.)

5. Select the <b>Bleed and Slug</b> drop-down menu in the right panel and set the bleed distance on all sides to 0.125 inches.
<b>Note:</b> Providing a bleed tells the printer where the edge of the page will be to allow the ink to cover the whole page, right up to the edge. The standard minimum bleed distance is 0.125 inches. This is the value that will be used in these instructions.

6. Click <b>Create</b> to create your project.

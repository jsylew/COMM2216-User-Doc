The following instructions will outline the steps for adding images and external PDF files to your booklet.

## Placing images in a file

1. Go to `[File] > [Place...]` and the "Place" window will appear.

  ![Place](https://github.com/jsylew/COMM2216-User-Doc/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/01-Place.png?raw=true "Placing Image")

2. Select the image file that you would like to add to your document from whichever directory it is stored in.

3. Click <b>Open</b> in the bottom right corner of the window to add the image.

4. Reformat your image to the desired size for your design.

><b>Note:</b> Images in InDesign are placed into a frame.  A single click on the image will select the frame for resizing and a double click on the image will select the image itself. Changing the size of the frame will change the amount of space that the image can occupy on the page.  Changing the size of the image will change how much of the image is visible within its frame.

The first image right shows a change in the size of the frame, depicted here by the black line.  The second image shows a change in the size of the image within the frame, as a more zoomed in view of the shark is displayed. 


5. Click on your image and navigate to the [Links] panel. Check the [Effective PPI] value and consider decreasing your image size if it is less than 300 PPI.
><b>Note:</b> The minimum standard resolution for printed images is 300 PPI (pixels per inch).

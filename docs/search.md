## My pages are not facing each other. How do I fix it?

   Go to `[File] > [Document Setup]`.

   ![Document Setup](https://github.com/jsylew/COMM2216-User-Doc/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Troubleshoot01.png?raw=true "Document Setup")

   Check the **[Facing Pages]** box.

## My exported PDF shows facing pages together. How do I make it export as single pages?

  In the export screen, make sure the **[Pages]** box and not the **[Spreads]** box is checked.

## The PDF I placed has a white background but it shows up transparent. How do I turn off the transparency?

  When you place the PDF, uncheck the **[Transparency] box.

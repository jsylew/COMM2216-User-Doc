1. My pages are not facing each other. How do I fix it?

   Go to `[File] > [Document Setup]`.
   ![Document Setup](https://github.com/jsylew/COMM2216-User-Doc/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Troubleshoot01.png?raw=true "Document Setup")

   Check the **[Facing Pages]** box.

2. My exported PDF shows facing pages together. How do I make it export as single pages?
    In the export screen, make sure the **[Pages]** box and not the **[Spreads]** box is checked.
